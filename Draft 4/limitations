Now our bank contract's functions can be called only by the Fund Manager. Also, we have a more sophesticated permissioning model for the fund manager (though very simple) 

But there are still many problems:
1. We do not have a system for handling multiple bank types
2. We do not have a mechanism if we swap a bank using setBank() function. What about all the data that's in there?
3. What if we want to update the permission model? We would have to replace the entire FundManager contract.
