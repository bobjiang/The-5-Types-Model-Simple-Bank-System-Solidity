Here we start by putting all the logic in one smart contract. 

This has many limitations:
1. It is not very scalable - When there are more users, they will demad for more features. You can put them in other contracts but then everything will be very disconnected.
2. The functions have no return values, so a contract that calls the bank can’t really know if it's call succeeded or not.
3. Users have to call the bank contract directly because it checks the caller address in both the deposit and withdraw functions, which means we can’t really use a proxy account.
